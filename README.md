# Introduction
Hello my name is Ryan Nolan-Hieb.

I'm majoring in Applied Computer Graphics with the "Technical" option. Hope to work on feature films in the future. Before transferring to Chico State I studied Computer Science at 
American River college. This is my final semester before graduating. WOHOO!!

I currently work at Theia Interactive, a start-up here in town. I'm a UE4 Blueprints programmer for them. Mainly doing UI stuff at the moment.
